This repository contains R scripts for performing hierarchical clustering and visualizing phenotypic data in plant research. The dataset comprises adjusted means for various traits across genotypes, standardized for clustering analysis. Key features of the code include implementing the elbow method and calculating within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) to determine optimal cluster numbers, visualizing clusters with a circular dendrogram using the circlize package, and computing RÂ² values to assess clustering accuracy. Cluster means are computed and saved for in-depth analysis of trait differences across clusters. This analysis is valuable for understanding trait grouping and genetic diversity patterns in the phenotypic dataset.
