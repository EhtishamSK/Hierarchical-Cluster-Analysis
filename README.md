This R script performs hierarchical clustering on a dataset of adjusted means, utilizing a circular dendrogram visualization to explore the relationships among different treatments. After setting the working directory and importing the data from a CSV file, the script loads necessary libraries, including circlize, dendextend, and dplyr. It computes a distance matrix using the Euclidean method and performs hierarchical clustering with the Ward.D2 method. The dendrogram is then customized by coloring branches and labels according to the defined number of clusters (four in this case) and adding genotype names for clarity. The circular dendrogram is plotted to provide a visual representation of the clustering results. The script further calculates and prints the mean values of selected traits for each cluster, saving the results to a CSV file for further analysis. Additionally, it assigns cluster labels to the original dataset and exports the updated data for downstream applications.
